# Ensemble-learning
Ensemble learning refers to a machine learning approach in which the predictions from multiple models are merged to enhance the accuracy and resilience of the ultimate forecast.
The underlying concept behind ensemble learning is to mitigate the errors or biases that may exist in individual models by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple models, which ultimately leads to a more precise prediction.
